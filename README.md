# tiny_vim

A project that tries to resemble basic [vim](https://www.vim.org/) functionalities. The only idea of this is learning how text editors and command line applications work, it's not meant to be useful at all.

### Building the project

```bash
bazel build --enable_bzlmod //:main
```

### Running the project

```bash
bazel run --enable_bzlmod //:main
```
